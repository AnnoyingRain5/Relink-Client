# Official Relink Client
This is the official client for the Relink chat service.

It is quite barebones, but it is functional.

This client is intended to be used from a command line, it does not come with a GUI, but there is nothing stopping you from making one!

Please note that the entire Relink project is still in development, and as such, this client is not yet fully functional.

## Submodule note:
This repository has git submodules, to clone them, use the `--recurse-submodules` flag, or run `git submodule update --init --recursive` after cloning.
